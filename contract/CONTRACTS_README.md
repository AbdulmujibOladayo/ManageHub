# ManageHub Smart Contracts

A comprehensive suite of Cairo 2 smart contracts for managing tech hubs on StarkNet, providing user management, workspace allocation, time tracking, access control, resource booking, and payroll processing.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The ManageHub smart contract suite consists of six main contract modules:

1. **UserManager** - User registration, biometric verification, and role management
2. **WorkspaceManager** - Workspace creation, allocation, and maintenance management  
3. **TimeTracker** - Clock-in/out system with biometric verification and time tracking
4. **AccessControl** - Resource access management and group-based permissions
5. **ResourceBooking** - Resource booking system with overlap prevention and recurring bookings
6. **Payroll** - Hourly rate management, pay calculation, and payroll processing

## üìã Contract Interfaces

### IUserManager
```cairo
trait IUserManager<TContractState> {
    fn register_user(ref self: TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, name: felt252, role: u8, biometric_hash: felt252);
    fn update_biometric(ref self: TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, new_biometric_hash: felt252);
    fn verify_biometric(self: @TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, biometric_hash: felt252) -> bool;
    fn get_user_role(self: @TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress) -> u8;
    fn is_user_active(self: @TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress) -> bool;
    fn deactivate_user(ref self: TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress);

### IResourceBooking
```cairo
trait IResourceBooking<TContractState> {
    fn book_resource(ref self: TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, resource_id: u32, start_time: u64, end_time: u64);
    fn cancel_booking(ref self: TContractState, booking_id: u32);
    fn get_resource_availability(self: @TContractState, resource_id: u32, date: u64) -> Array<(u64, u64)>;
    fn create_recurring_booking(ref self: TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, resource_id: u32, pattern: u8, duration: u64);
}
```

**Recurring Patterns:**
- 0: Daily
- 1: Weekly
- 2: Monthly

### IPayroll
```cairo
trait IPayroll<TContractState> {
    fn set_hourly_rate(ref self: TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, rate: u256);
    fn calculate_pay(self: @TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, period_start: u64, period_end: u64) -> u256;
    fn process_payroll(ref self: TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, period_start: u64, period_end: u64);
    fn add_bonus(ref self: TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, amount: u256, reason: felt252);
    fn deduct_amount(ref self: TContractState, user_address: ContractAddress, amount: u256, reason: felt252);
}
```

## üß™ Testing

The contract suite includes comprehensive unit tests and integration tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
scarb test

# Run specific test file
snforge test test_user_manager
snforge test test_workspace_manager
snforge test test_time_tracker
snforge test test_access_control
snforge test test_resource_booking
snforge test test_payroll
snforge test test_integration
```

## üì¶ Deployment

All contracts are designed to work independently or as an integrated suite. Deploy in the following order for full integration:

1. UserManager
2. WorkspaceManager  
3. AccessControl
4. ResourceBooking
5. TimeTracker
6. Payroll

## üîß Configuration

Each contract accepts an owner address in the constructor. The owner has administrative privileges and can delegate specific permissions to other users through the role and access control systems.

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Complete Employee Onboarding
```cairo
// 1. Register employee
user_manager.register_user(employee_addr, 'John Doe', ROLE_MEMBER, biometric_hash);

// 2. Allocate workspace
workspace_manager.allocate_workspace(employee_addr, workspace_id);

// 3. Grant resource access
access_control.grant_access(employee_addr, resource_id, ACCESS_WRITE);

// 4. Set payroll rate
payroll.set_hourly_rate(employee_addr, hourly_rate);
```

### Daily Operations
```cairo
// Clock in
time_tracker.clock_in(employee_addr, workspace_id, biometric_hash);

// Book meeting room
resource_booking.book_resource(employee_addr, meeting_room_id, start_time, end_time);

// Clock out
time_tracker.clock_out(employee_addr, biometric_hash);

// Process payroll (end of period)
payroll.process_payroll(employee_addr, period_start, period_end);
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- All administrative functions are protected by owner checks
- Biometric verification prevents unauthorized access
- Role-based permissions ensure proper authorization
- Event logging provides audit trails for all operations
- Input validation prevents invalid state transitions

## üîÑ Integration Points

The contracts are designed to work together:
- TimeTracker integrates with UserManager for biometric verification
- Payroll integrates with TimeTracker for accurate hour calculation
- AccessControl can be used with ResourceBooking for authorization
- WorkspaceManager tracks user allocations for TimeTracker context

## üìà Gas Optimization

- Efficient storage patterns using Maps instead of LegacyMaps
- Minimal storage reads/writes in critical paths
- Batch operations where possible
- Event-driven architecture for off-chain indexing
